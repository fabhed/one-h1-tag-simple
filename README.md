For a simple website with only one h1 tag, we will need the following files:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application instance and the route definition for our single page.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML template for our single page. It will contain the h1 tag with the text "Fabian was here".

3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that our application needs to run.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:

app.py
