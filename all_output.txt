For a simple website with only one h1 tag, we will need the following files:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application instance and the route definition for our single page.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML template for our single page. It will contain the h1 tag with the text "Fabian was here".

3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that our application needs to run.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:

app.py
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    # This function will render the index.html template when the home route is accessed.
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Next, we will create the `index.html` file inside a `templates` directory:

templates/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Simple Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Fabian was here</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Finally, we will create the `requirements.txt` file to list our Python dependencies:

requirements.txt
```txt
Flask==1.1.2
```

To run this application, you would first install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then run the application with `python app.py`. The website will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
